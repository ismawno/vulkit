[cmake-options]
;this file was generated by the 'cmake_scanner.py' script.
;you may add/edit key-value pairs in this section and changes will be reflected as long as the format is correct. running 'cmake_scanner.py' again will not override your changes. other sections you add will also remain untouched. all keys/section names should be lower case, except when creating override sections (explained above).
;hyphen ('-') and underscore ('_') separators are interchangeable in this file. you may use either. the cmake options will always end up with underscores, but the command line options will be hyphenated, no matter what.
;this section format goes as follows: <lowercase-cmake-option> = <lowercase-build-cli-option>: <default-value>
;you may write <lowercase-cmake-option> = <default-value> if you wish to use the same name for both.
;<lowercase-cmake-option> -> it is the raw cmake option name in lower case (python parser requires it), except for the '-d' prefix.
;<lowercase-build-cli-option> -> it is the corresponding 'ergonomic' command line option for the 'build.py' script. it is just a convenience.
;<default-value> -> it is the value 'build.py' will use if no other value is provided through the command line. if the value is a boolean, you may use 'true/on/yes' or 'false/off/no'. case insensitive.

;you can override default values for some options when other options take specific values by creating new sections as follows:
;[<lowercase-cmake-option>.<value-that-triggers-override>]
;<lowercase-build-cli-option> = <new-default-value>
;this is useful when you would like to disable assertions or logs for distribution builds.
;you can stack empty override sections to have those inherit the values of the bottom section:
;[<lowercase-cmake-option-1>.<value-that-triggers-override-1>]
;[<lowercase-cmake-option-2>.<value-that-triggers-override-2>]
;<value-that-triggers-override> may have uppercase letters, as well as <new-default-value> or <default-value>.
