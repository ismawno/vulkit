# Vulkit

Vulkit is a C++ Vulkan library I have designed to simplify and streamline working with the Vulkan API. Its primary focus is to accelerate the headache that is the Vulkan initialization process. In addition, it provides high-level abstractions for essential components in graphics programming, such as buffers, descriptors, swap chains, command pools, and more, making it a versatile tool for Vulkan-based development.

This library was started as I realized how many interesting projects the Vulkan API had unlocked for me, especially regarding graphics programming and GPGPU. I originally had a somewhat hardcoded setup in [onyx](https://github.com/ismawno/onyx) (an application framework library I am still developing), which I didnâ€™t really like because of its lack of flexibility. So, taking inspiration from the great [vk-bootstrap](https://github.com/charles-lunarg/vk-bootstrap) library, I decided to implement my own.

The reason I decided against using an existing Vulkan library to handle all of this for me is because I am actually very interested in the initialization and low-level manipulation of the library. Plus, I wanted to have control over the design choices and coding style.

## Features

Vulkit focuses on Vulkan API abstractions, which can be summed up as follows:
- **Significant speedup of the Vulkan API initialization process**
- **Significant speedup of instance, physical device, and logical device creation**
- **Useful abstractions of essential components of the Vulkan API, such as buffers, command pools, swap chains, render passes, etc.**

In addition, it also features its own loader, which pulls all available vulkan functions once at the start.

### API Initialization

In Vulkit, Vulkan initialization consists of 4 steps:

1. Vulkan function loader, instance extensions and layers support querying
2. Instance creation
3. Physical device selection
4. Logical device creation

All of these steps are pretty straightforward, especially the first one, consisting of a single function call:

```cpp
const auto vkres = VKit::Core::Initialize();
if (!vkres)
{
    // Handle error
}
```

Almost all Vulkit API calls will return a result object. It supports a trivial `bool` implicit conversion. When the function is expected to return a value, a `Result` object will be provided, allowing you to access the underlying value with the `GetValue()` method, assuming no error occurred.

Vulkit provides an easy and convenient way of checking these results using the logging capabilities of the [toolkit](https://github.com/ismawno/toolkit) through the following macros: `VKIT_[ASSERT|LOG|WARN]_VULKAN_RESULT(result)`

Moving on:

```cpp
const auto vkres = VKit::Core::Initialize();
VKIT_ASSERT_RESULT(result);
```

Creating an instance is straightforward as well with the `VKit::Instance::Builder` object:

```cpp
const char *extensions[] = {/* my extensions */};
const auto result = VKit::Instance::Builder()
                        .SetApplicationName("Onyx")
                        .RequireApiVersion(1, 1, 0)
                        .RequireExtensions(extensions)
                        .RequestExtension("VK_extra_extension")
                        .RequestValidationLayers()
                        .Build();
VKIT_ASSERT_RESULT(result);
const VKit::Instance &instance = result.GetValue();
// Rest of the code...
```

The result object returned encapsulates a `VKit::Instance` object, which contains a `VkInstance` handle. Almost all Vulkit objects, including `VKit::Instance`, are simple, trivially copyable POD classes. This design means resource cleanup is entirely the user's responsibility. However, Vulkit minimizes the effort required by providing `Destroy()` and `SubmitForDeletion()` methods for all classes that manage Vulkan resources. Additionally, a `DeletionQueue` class is available for use with the `SubmitForDeletion()` method to streamline cleanup.

You can create a headless Vulkan instance by calling `SetHeadless(true)` on the builder, which will exclude the necessary extensions for presentation.

Physical and logical device creation follows a very similar pattern:

```cpp
const VkSurfaceKHR surface = /* get surface */;
const auto physres =
    VKit::PhysicalDevice::Selector(&instance)
        .SetSurface(surface)
        .PreferType(VKit::PhysicalDevice::Discrete)
        .AddFlags(VKit::PhysicalDevice::Selector::Flag_AnyType | VKit::PhysicalDevice::Selector::Flag_PortabilitySubset |
                    VKit::PhysicalDevice::Selector::Flag_RequireGraphicsQueue)
        .Select();
VKIT_ASSERT_RESULT(physres);
const VKit::PhysicalDevice &phys = physres.GetValue();

const auto devres = VKit::LogicalDevice::Create(s_Instance, phys);
VKIT_ASSERT_RESULT(devres);
```

Note that if the instance is not headless, a surface must be provided to select an appropriate physical device.

There are many more options available for both the [instance.hpp](https://github.com/ismawno/vulkit/blob/main/vulkit/vkit/backend/instance.hpp) and [physical_device.hpp](https://github.com/ismawno/vulkit/blob/main/vulkit/vkit/backend/physical_device.hpp) creation, which can be explored by inspecting the corresponding class definitions.


### Swap chain

The [swap_chain.hpp](https://github.com/ismawno/vulkit/blob/main/vulkit/vkit/rendering/swap_chain.hpp) abstraction streamlines the process of creating a swap chain, which can otherwise be cumbersome due to the variety of formats and parameters. Vulkit uses the same builder pattern as instance and device handles:

```cpp
const auto result =
    VKit::SwapChain::Builder(&device, window.GetSurface())
        .RequestSurfaceFormat({VK_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8_UNORM, VK_COLOR_SPACE_SRGB_NONLINEAR_KHR})
        .RequestPresentMode(presentMode)
        .RequestExtent(windowExtent)
        .SetOldSwapChain(swapChain)
        .AddFlags(VKit::SwapChain::Builder::Flag_Clipped | VKit::SwapChain::Builder::Flag_CreateImageViews)
        .Build();

VKIT_ASSERT_RESULT(result);
```

### Render pass

The [render_pass.hpp](https://github.com/ismawno/vulkit/blob/main/vulkit/vkit/rendering/render_pass.hpp) abstraction simplifies the creation and management of Vulkan render passes, which can be complex due to the need to configure attachments, subpasses, and dependencies. Vulkit uses a flexible builder pattern to define render passes and provides utilities for managing associated resources like frame buffers and image views:

```cpp
const auto result =
    VKit::RenderPass::Builder(&device, imageCount)
        .SetAllocator(Core::GetVulkanAllocator())
        // Color attachment 0
        .BeginAttachment(VKit::Attachment::Flag_Color)
        .RequestFormat(info.SurfaceFormat.format)
        .SetFinalLayout(VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PRESENT_SRC_KHR)
        .EndAttachment()
        // DepthStencil attachment 1
        .BeginAttachment(VKit::Attachment::Flag_Depth | VKit::Attachment::Flag_Stencil)
        .RequestFormat(VK_FORMAT_D32_SFLOAT_S8_UINT)
        .SetFinalLayout(VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL)
        .EndAttachment()
        // Subpass 0
        .BeginSubpass(VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS)
        .AddColorAttachment(0)
        .SetDepthStencilAttachment(1)
        .EndSubpass()
        // Dependency
        .BeginDependency(VK_SUBPASS_EXTERNAL, 0)
        .SetAccessMask(0, VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT | VK_ACCESS_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT)
        .SetStageMask(VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_BOTTOM_OF_PIPE_BIT,
                        VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT | VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_EARLY_FRAGMENT_TESTS_BIT)
        .EndDependency()
        .Build();

VKIT_ASSERT_RESULT(result);
```

Once all of the render pass specification has been declared, it is possible to create the underlying resources as follows:

```cpp
const VKit::SwapChain::Info &info = m_SwapChain.GetInfo();
const auto result =
    m_RenderPass.CreateResources(info.Extent, [this, &info](const VKit::ImageHouse &p_ImageHouse,
                                                            const u32 p_ImageIndex, const u32 p_AttachmentIndex) {
        if (p_AttachmentIndex == 0)
            return p_ImageHouse.CreateImage(info.ImageData[p_ImageIndex].ImageView);

        const VKit::RenderPass::Attachment &attachment = m_RenderPass.GetAttachment(p_AttachmentIndex);
        return p_ImageHouse.CreateImage(attachment.Description.format, info.Extent, attachment.Flags);
    });
VKIT_ASSERT_RESULT(result);
```

The result encapsulates a struct of type RenderPass::Resource, which the user is responsible for freeing. Even though this simplifies Vulkan's render pass interaction, it is still recommended to use dynamic rendering.

### Other Abstractions

Vulkit provides many more abstractions, slightly simpler than the ones presented so far and using very similar building patterns:

- [command_pool.hpp](https://github.com/ismawno/vulkit/blob/main/vulkit/vkit/backend/command_pool.hpp): Simplifies the allocation and deallocation of command buffers, reducing verbosity.

- [buffers](https://github.com/ismawno/vulkit/tree/main/vulkit/vkit/buffer): Provides both low-level and high-level abstractions for various buffer usages (device-local and host-visible), as well as utility functions for creating vertex, index, uniform, and storage buffers.

- [descriptors](https://github.com/ismawno/vulkit/tree/main/vulkit/vkit/descriptors): Includes three abstractions for managing descriptor pools, descriptor set layouts, and descriptor sets.

- [pipelines and shaders](https://github.com/ismawno/vulkit/tree/main/vulkit/vkit/pipeline): Offers abstractions for both graphics and compute pipelines. Additionally, a `Shader` class is provided, capable of compiling GLSL shaders into SPIR-V format by invoking the `glslc` compiler.

- [pipeline job](https://github.com/ismawno/vulkit/blob/main/vulkit/vkit/pipeline/pipeline_job.hpp): Automates resource binding and push constant ranges for a graphics or compute pipeline.

## Dependencies and Third-Party Libraries

Vulkit relies on Vulkan, VMA and shaderc to work. `CMake` will try to detect these dependencies for you and pull them locally if not found.

## Versioning

Try to always use a tagged commit when using the library, as I can guarantee those will build and be stable.

## Building

The building process is straightforward. Using `CMake`:

```sh
cmake --preset release
cmake --build --preset release
